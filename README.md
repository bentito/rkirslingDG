Directed Graph Code From Ross Kirsling

Pros: Simple usage, pretty much pure JS, just imports D3

`index.html`, `app.js` and `app.css` are from Kirsling's original code. 
This version adds the Bootstrap framework.

Also adds Ross's copyright message as a header to the above files, this is 
basically a share-and-share-alike type license.

To see the graph editor work:

Just open `index.html` in a browser to see it work.

Note: This code is broken out (by Kirsling) from Kirsling's larger work: http://rkirsling.github.io/modallogic/
